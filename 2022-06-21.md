# 2022-06-21: Thundering Herd Problem

- [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem)
- Originally described a problem with competing for kernel resources
- In microservices, it describes a large number of clients sending requests at once, causing some failure
- To mitigate, you need more than just a backoff strategy, because client retries can still come in large batches, re-triggering the problem
- So, add jitter (random delay) in retries to stagger them and spread them out
