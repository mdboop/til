# 2022-11-14 Vanillin

Pure vanilla extract vs. artifical vanilla flavor vs. imitation vanilla flavor all contain the exact same vanillin compound, just extracted from the vanilla bean or synthesized from wood or wood pulp. Some (presumably) regulatory factors distinguish what can be called what, but the compound is exactly the same. Of course, like any natural flavor, the main compound is just one of many compounds that contribute to the overall olfactory sensation, but those secondary compoounds are highly volatile and break down when exposed to high heat. So, if you're baking, you could use imitation vanilla (~$0.31/oz) instead of pure vanilla extract (~$3.50/oz) and get an identical result. But if you're making ice cream or something that won't be exposed to high heat, you might be better off using the real stuff if you want that more complex taste and aroma.
